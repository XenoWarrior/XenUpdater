		-NEWS [**SHARP DROP SHADOWEFFECT ON THE TEXT**]
		-PATCH NOTES
		-SERVER STATUS: 	ONLINE (THIS IS FONT SIZE 12)

	"KOZUKA GOTHIC PRO" FONT, SIZE 11, FOR THE FOLLOWING TEXT SECTIONS (FROM TOP LEFT TO BOTTOM RIGHT):
		-Read More... [**SHARP DROP SHADOWEFFECT ON THE TEXT**]

		-(PATCH VERSION AND LOG TEXT)
		-DOWNLOADING PERECENT %
		-Downloading... (STATUS)

>THE PATCH NOTE SECTION INCLUDES A ROUNDED THIN SCROLLBAR
>THE HEADER SECTION (WHERE ALL THE WEBSITE, REGISTER, ETC) HAS A HOVER EFFECT, TO WHITE
>The "Read More..." and "NEWS DATES AND TITLES" are hyperlinks, so a simple hover effect on them would be cool too.
